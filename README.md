# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind css

This app is built using the Vite boilerplate with React and TypeScript. For styling it use Tailwind css cause itis a simple way to style the application quickly and consistently without spending time on custom CSS or design details . It also includes ESLint for code linting.

## Project structure

For this technical test, I chose a lightweight structure (app / api / hooks / pages / components / types /utils) instead of a classic clean architecture setup.
cause it reduces boilerplate,it is suitable for a small scope project like this one while keeping concerns well separated.
